  <center>So finally <br> 2022 ended <br> 
  Day by day nothing changes but when you look back everything is diffrent
  we dont notice moments until they turn into memories<br>
  If anyone asks me which is best year you lived till now ,i will say 2022
  ,its because i lived some best moments with you , <br>i wish i could turn back time and 
  live them again , but time doesnt go backwards. Wish time could move slower when everything 
  feels good .Its the little meemories that will last forever .<br>
  <br><b>you</b> reeading this , look how far you have made i am proud of you  .<br>
   If you feel like saying some shit about whats on your mind i will there to listen you <br>
   Sorry if i ever ignored you , annoyed you , argued with you ,it will happen again.<br><br>
   This year is starting with pre boards , so i wont say its a happy new year but not a sad one<BR><br>
    "Some of the best things in life are temporory enjoy them at your fullest"
    <br>past will not come back <br>everything will be okay<br> 
    year ends everything in the corner of this floating world swept.
